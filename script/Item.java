	//I imagine this to be the prime example of "pointless abstraction."
	//This class is empty, because items are meant to be the "purest" form of cards.
	//They only have an activated effect, which is defined for all other cards as well.
	//"So why make the Card.java class abstract?" I hear you ask.
	//Well... that's a very good question. I have no idea.
